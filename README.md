# CareerEnder

**CareerEnder** is a type of **Windows prankware** that is designed to make the victim panic, by playing very loud *questionable* sounds.

### What it does:
- Moves itself to `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\procmgr.exe`
- Creates a task that runs the program every minute
- Blocks keyboard input and mouse movement
- Repeatedly unmutes and sets master volume to 100%
- Plays a very loud *silly* sound
- Stops execution when the user types "daddy" on his keyboard
- Destroys the victims career and possible future careers

### How to remove:
- Type "daddy" on your keyboard
- Open task scheduler and delete "Microsoft Process Manager" (default task name)
- Delete `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\procmgr.exe`

### This program causes NO HARM to the computer. It's only designed to play a loud sound (moan by default). I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE OF ANY EMBARASSEMENT CAUSED BY THIS PROGRAM.

I am planning on making it always play the sounds from the speakers, completely ignoring headphones.
